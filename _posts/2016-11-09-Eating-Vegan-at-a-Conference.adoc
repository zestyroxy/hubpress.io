= Eating Vegan at a Conference
:hp-image: 

:hp-tags: [vegan, how to, food, conference,]

A few weeks ago, I attended one of the three annual conferences my company holds. This particular conference is hosted in Germany. This was my first conference after choosing to become vegan and I honestly, I was worried. Would I survive this trip as a vegan and what would I be surviving on.

As I went through the experience, I thought it would be helpful to share a few tips! So here we go:

*Before the conference*
Don't wait until the last minute to start thinking about how you will survive on a plant-based diet at a conference. 

+++<u>Registration:</u>+++
When registering for the conference, keep your eyes peeled for a field about food preferences or special requests. If you didn't find such a field on the form, reach out to the organizers and ask if there will be a vegan option offered onsite. Any organizers worth their salt will reply!

+++<u>Hotel:</u>+++
Contact the hotel your will be staying at and ask about vegan options for breakfast, dinner and lunch. If they don't have option, plan time to shop when you get there.

+++<u>Trip/Flights:</u>+++
International flights offer vegan options. They aren't always tasty. For those who don't know, you +++<u>can</u>+++ bring food through security, but no liquids over 100 ml. I always bring protein and snacks in my carry-on and choose a fruit only meal o international flights. Fruits are light and tasty, full of vitamins and I don't feel gross when I land. This time around I departed from the Toronto airport and they had vegan options, but don't count on your airport having any options. 

*Onsite* Once you get there, get informed!

+++<u>Hotel:</u>+++
If they haven't replied to your inquiries, ask the front desk about vegan options when you check-in. When you get to your room, check if there is a mini fridge to store food later.

+++<u>Shop</u>+++
Hopefully, the conference centre will be located downtown or close to a grocery store or bio store. As soon you get 30 minutes to yourself, bolt to the store to stock up on snacks, nuts, bread, spreads, muesli/oats, chocolate (of course), fruits and veggies.

If your hotel room has a mini-fridge, this is a huge bonus. Otherwise, not a problem. Get mini boxes of dairy milk and get to feel like a 5 year old again!

+++<u>Restaurants</u>+++
Many restaurants now offer vegan options, but don't necessarily advertise it. Take the inivitative to research vegan friendly places so you can suggest them when making plans with clients or colleagues. They will appreaciate you organizing the dinner plans! If they already made arrangement, just call the restaurant to confirm that they have vegan options.

A great website to research restaurants is happycow.net. They don't list restaurants that have only 1 vegan option, so you might want to want to do a Google as well "vegan restaurants in CITY".

+++<u>Bar</u>+++:
Did you know that some alchoholic beverages aren't vegan?! To be safe, look up your drink of choice on barnivore.com - it's a great resource!
