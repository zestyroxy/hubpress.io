= Eating Vegan at a Conference

:hp-tags: [vegan, how to, food, conference]

A few weeks ago, I attend one of the three annual conferences my company holds. The conference is EclipseCon Europe and took place in Ludwigsburg, Germany. This was my first conference after choosing to become vegan and I thought I would share a few tips.

+++<u>Prepare</u>+++
Don't wait until the last minute to start thinking about how you will survive on a plant-based diet at a conference. 

Travel
[square]
* International flights offer vegan options. They aren't always tasty, so I plan ahead and bring protein on the plane and choose a fruit only meal. That way I get my vitamins and protein on the plane. The toronto airport has vegan options, but don't count on your airport having any options, so pack a lunch! You can bring food through security, but no liquids.

Conference
* Keep your eyes peeled when completing the registration form. Was there an option to choose a vegan meal? If not, reach out to the organizers and ask if there will be a vegan option offered onsite.
* Contact the hotel your will be staying at and ask about vegan options for breakfast, dinner and lunch.

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++

. Set the oven to 175 C.
. Place the oats in a large bowl, add brown sugar, and mix thoroughly with you hands.
. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil and maple syrup. Once mixed, add immediately to the oats and sugar mixture. Stir until all the oat flakes are covered in the oil mixture. I used a fork to do this.
. Add the seeds or nuts and stir until evenly combined.
