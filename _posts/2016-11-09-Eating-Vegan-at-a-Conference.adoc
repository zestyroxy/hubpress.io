= Eating Vegan at a Conference

A few weeks ago, I attend one of the three annual conferences my company holds. The  Germany. This was my first conference after choosing to become vegan and I thought I would share a few tips.

+++<u>Prepare</u>+++
Don't wait until the last minute to start thinking about how you will survive on a plant-based diet at a conference. 

+++<u>Trip</u>+++

* International flights offer vegan options. They aren't always tasty, so I plan ahead and bring protein on the plane and choose a fruit only meal. That way I get my vitamins and protein on the plane. The toronto airport has vegan options, but don't count on your airport having any options, so pack a lunch! You can bring food through security, but no liquids.

+++<u>Conference</u>+++

* Keep your eyes peeled when completing the registration form. Was there an option to choose a vegan meal? If not, reach out to the organizers and ask if there will be a vegan option offered onsite.
* Contact the hotel your will be staying at and ask about vegan options for breakfast, dinner and lunch. If they don't have option, plan time to shop when you get there.

+++<u>Shop</u>+++
Hopefully, your conference will be located downtown or close to a grocery store or bio store. Google the location in advance and as soon as you get 30 minutes to yourself, bolt to the store to stock up on snacks, nuts, bread, spreads, muesli/oats, chocolate (of course), fruits and veggies.

If your hotel room has a mini-fridge, this is a huge bonus. Otherwise, not a problem. Get mini boxes of dairy milk and get to feel like a 5 year old again! 

+++<u>Restaurants</u>+++
Many restaurants now offer vegan options, but don't always advertise it. You can call a restaurant in advance to ask if they accomodate vegans your colleagues have made dinner plans. 
Research vegan or vegan-friendly restaurants  in the area. A great website to do this is happycow.net, but I find Google also works in some cases.
