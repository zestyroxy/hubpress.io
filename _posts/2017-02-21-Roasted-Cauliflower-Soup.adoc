This weekend I had a serious craving for cauliflower soup so I improvised this lazy lunch. My friend Stephanie asked for the recipe, so this one is decicated to her. Enjoy!

+++<u>Ingredients</u>+++
[square]
- 1 small cauliflower head
- 1 small yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 1/2 tbsp sesame oil
- 4 slices baguette
- 1/2 square vegetable broth
- 1/2 can coconut milk
- 1 cup water
- salt & pepper
- 2 tsp thyme
- 2 tbsp crispy onions (optional)
- green garnish (optional)

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++
[square]
- Pre-head the oven to 180C.
- Cut the cauliflower into strips that are 5 mm thick and cut the onion and the garlic cloves in half. 
- Toss the veggies in 2 tbsp of sesame oil.
- Cover baking sheet with parchement paper and spread the oil coated veggies on top.
- Place into the over and bake until the florets get golden brown, 20-30 minutes.
- While the veggies are baking, cut your bread into small squares. Cover with a bit of sesame oil.
- Add your bread squares to the baking sheet while the rest is baking. Leave them in there only until golden brown, 3-5 minutes, take them out again.
- Once the cauliflower is golden brown (a few blackish spots are fine) take the pan out of the oven.
- Place all the veggies in a pot, leaving out the croutons.
- Add water, coconut milk and vegetable broth to the pot. Feel free to add more coconut milk or water if you don't like thick soups.
- Add salt and pepper to taste.
- Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 15 minutes.
- Blend your soup with a hand blender or in a highspeed blender. Always hold the cover of your blender before pressing start because the heat might make it fly off. :) Depending on your blender you might want to only blend 1/3 of the soup at a time.
- Let it blend for a few minutes to get a nice smooth consistency.
