This year, we decided to SKIP Christmas! OK, technically that isn't true, but we decided to break tradition and stay home. The decision was made a few months early because we wanted to spend some quiet time with ourselves; ourselves as people and together as a couple.
For all four "big" days/evenings, we stayed home and cooked lovely meals together. We also spent 2 of our 10 days off days in Hamburg, our favourite German city. There we watched Rogue One at the http://www.savoy-filmtheater.de/ [Savoy Theatre]. This theatre is wonderful because it shows films in their original version, that can be hard to find in Germany, and it has Vegan popcorn - salty, sweet, and caramel! We walked around the beautiful city, peaked into shops, had treats at the Weihnachtsmarkt and bought some of our favourite coffee at the http://www.speicherstadt-kaffee.de/[Speicherstadt Kaffeerösterei]. For dinner we ate delicious vegan pizza at http://www.pizza-bande.de/ [Pizza Bande] and Sushi at http://www.raw-like-sushi.de/en/ [Raw Like Sushi]. The rest of the time was spent relaxing at home reading, napping, doing yoga, baking, or out with friends. Our biggest outing was our friends' small and wonderful wedding.
It was the most wonderful Christmas time since I stopped believing in Santa Claus. The past week was so calm, quiet, relaxing, and fulfilling. I had time to let go of work, find myself again and do what I love. I even found new passions and interest; this only happens when my brain is calm. 
This week, I spoke with a few friends and they mentioned that they felt like they needed a holiday from their holiday. Which is why I want to share tips on how to spend a Merry Minimalist Holiday Season!

== Tips
+++<u>Stay Home or Elope</u>+++
My best advice for a calm holiday season is to escape. Create your own hideout or escape to a remote location with someone you feel %100 comfortable with; that can mean yourself. Once in your hideout, relax, let go, and be yourself. Now, explore the emotions you’ve been bottling up all year because you’ve been too busy to process them. Once that is done – explore the world & learn new things.
During those four important days, both Christmas and New Year’s eves/days, don’t worry about where you SHOULD be or COULD be, just be happy with where you are now. Have a lovely dinner and celebrate what you’re thankful for. Oh, and called your loved ones – you might be eloping but you’re still a decent loving person. Right?
+++<u>Don't Over Schedule</u>+++
Rushing sucks. We can't help but feel rushed during the holidays. So many things to get done, so many people around trying to complete their gift list. Plan only a few things and for the rest, just go with the flow. Do what you feel like doing, when you feel like doing  it.
+++<u>Fuck Gift Giving</u>+++
We are all adults here. I hope. Kids if you're reading this... ah fuck it. If you can read, you’ve seen these words before. So, we’re all adults here. We know what we want, what we need, and we can go out and get whatever we want, whenever we want. In fact, we can open a magical box, type in our wishes and use a magical card code that sends an invisible promise of money to get these wants and needs delivered straight to our door. You could do this solely with your little finger, if you choose to. Point is, we don't need gifts and we don't need to give gifts to be happy and merry.
During the holidays, my favourite thing to do is eat and share the food love. Homemade food-love cures all. If you must buy something for someone, make it consumable, preferably edible and homemade :) Examples are: Cinema gift card, pay for a dinner with them, give them wine, bake them cookies!
If you're going to cancel gift giving, be sure to inform your family ahead of time. It’s just the decent thing to do. This also means they might (hopefully) stop buying you gifts and you can stop lying to their faces about loving said gifts! If you actually love the presents your family give you that is wonderful, but they should know that you prefer time with them.
+++<u>Ring in the New Year Debt-free</u>+++
The great thing about not buying gifts is you don't have to stress out about money. Period.
+++<u>Eat</u>+++
Spend time eating what you love. Share it with loved ones. Eat mindfully and enjoy it! The best time I spend in the kitchen is cooking with my partner Stefan. We get creative and have fun with it. If it burns or tastes horrible, don't sweat it, make simple nachos or order take-out! 
+++<u>Hobbies</u>+++
Take a few days to just reconnect with yourself and do what you really love. Read, travel to a new place, sleep, cook, blog, have sex, whatever YOU want.

+++<u>Declutter your Life</u>+++
This one is a big one, but I used to have a big house with 14 rooms and a lot of furniture, trinkets and useless decorations. Now, I live in a 1 bedroom apartment, there is only two of us after all, and only keep the necessities around. This means that, cleaning and welcoming guests isn't stressful because cleaning the entire place takes less than an hour a week! The lack of clutter will already remove half of the weight off your shoulders. To learn more about decluttering, read this fine article about decluttering your life!

+++<u>Final words</u>+++
I realize some of the points mentioned above conflict with one another, but you don’t have to take every slice of advice. Adapt it and make it your own – you know yourself best! And please, stop worrying about what other will think or feel. Choose to do something that you love. Something for you and the family members living in your home.
