I thought rum soaked raisins and persimmon would be amazing in a bowl of porridge and I wasn't wrong! Here is the recipe.

+++<u>Ingredients</u>+++
[square]
- 3/4 cup oats (I use "Haferflocken Feinblatt", but use your favourite)
- 1 1/2 cup soy milk (you can use water or any non-dairy milk)
- 1 persimmon
- 4 tbsp raisins or cut up apricots (pre-soaked)
- 4 tbsp rum
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/8 tsp cardamom

*Optional Toppings*
[square]
- 1-2 tbsp maple syrup
- handful cocoa nibs or chopped walnuts

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++

*Evening*

The evening before, place the raisins, apricots and rum in a tupperware. Shut it tightly, shake it up a bit and let that sit overnight. This can be done a few days in advance or in larger quantities, just make the content ratio 1:1.

- Peel the persimmon and cut it up into small pieces. Save a few thin slices for decoration. I save 1 slice per bowl.
- Add all the ingredients to a pot, except for the toppings

[square]
- Heat the content on high heat until it boils/bubbles. Set heat to low. Remember to stir constantly or it will stick to the bottom of the pot.
- Stir until it is thick - I prefer it very thick, but that is not for everyone.
- Taste it and add more spices to satisfy your taste buds.
- If the oats aren't yet ready, but the consistency is thick you can either: add a bit of water and let them sit a bit longer over the heat OR simply take them off the heat and let the covered pot rest for a few minutes.
- Pour porridge into the bowl, sprinkle the cocoa nibs or walnuts on top, pour a bit of maple syrup for extra sweetness and place your persimmon slice.

Now, prepare your favourite cup of tea or coffee and devour! I adore getting up early, bundling myself up and eating porridge as the sun rises. It's so relaxing and makes you appreciate the worlds beauty.
