The first weekend of December, we travelled south to visit Leipzig - one of our favourite cities! We were very excited to explore the Weihnachtsmarkt (German Christmas Market) and the beautiful city once again. We haven't been there since we became vegan and were eager to discover vegan restaurants and stores in a different city.

== Friday
We left Kiel in the early afternoon with a few vegan sandwiches we made at home (walnut bread with salted butter, chia seed breads w/peanut butter & jelly and chia seed bread w/beet & horseradish spread) and a nougat ring for dessert! I also got my first Starbucks coffee in over half a year - Soy Latte because their Christmas drink syrup wasn't vegan. :(

We spent the entire trainride working, which means we were tired when we got to the city. It was cold and all we wanted in that moment was to get to our Airbnb near the city centre and nap.

The "plan" (we all know how plans work out ;)) was to eat at http://restaurant-greensoul.de/[Green Soul] located near our rental apartment. It looks like an amazing vegetarian/vegan restaurant! I had been dreaming of their walnut burger and crème brulée for weeks.

Unfortunately, we were too late to eat there that evening. We even tried ordering from their menu on Foodora, but that didn't work out because of a technical problem on Foodora's side. Sadly, we never made it to Green Soul that weekend; we had other plans on Saturday and the restaurant is closed on Sundays. I will make a point to eat there next time I visit.

By 22:30 we made it to a sushi place we like called http://mrmoto.de/[Mr. Moto]. They have really tasty veggie california rolls. We were too hungry and forgot to ask if the veggie sushi was vegan (sometimes there is fish sauce in the rice). It was delicious.

== Saturday
Saturday morning, we had plans to visit the aformentioned Christmas Marketing with Stefan's family. Before meeting up with them, we stopped by http://www.goodies-berlin.de/kategorie/leipzig/[Goodies] and https://veganz.de/en/[Veganz] - all vegan shop and cantine. It was simply delicious. For breakfast we had this amazing egg salad bagel (made with chickpeas, spelt pasta with fresh herbs and tomato) and the "Get up and Goji" smoothie (made with fresh pineapples, strawberries, gojibeberries, banana, and orange juice). It was like a punch of freshness in the face. Definitely made me get up and go.

Of course we also had coffee, a soy cappuccino and a peanut buttercup latte. My latte was definitely interesting, and tasted good, but a lot of peanut butter was left at the bottom once the coffee was gone. I probably wouldn't order it again.

For lunch we had Indian food, it wasn't great and is not worth describing :) Spent the rest of the day traipsing around the market. Our favourite treat is candied almonds - which are luckily vegan! They are served warm which is nice when it's so cold.

For dinner, we had sushi at Mr. Moto once again and ordered more of the veggie california rolls!


== Sunday
On Sunday, we travelled to another part of the city, Lindenau, to have brunch at http://www.suesssalzig.de/[süß + salzig]. It did not disappoint! An amazing spread of vegan food layed out on two buffet tables. We stayed there for 3 hours, eating, relaxing, reading. It was wonderful. I only got a photo of the coffee - I was enjoying the food too much. They had different vegan spreads including nutella, kalamata olive, pumpkin, 'creton', butter, ... and more. We also stuffed our faces with cake, a tomato and seitan hedgehog, bread, sweet semolina porridge, cereal and mandarins. The buffet table can be viewed in the background of this images.

Once we were satisfied, we went back to the city centre. Usually stores are closed on Sundays, but it was "city open day" that Sunday, which means that the Veganz store and Goodies restaurant were open! We walked around the city and visited a few local shops. Before hopping on the train, we stopped at Goodies for a coffee and purchased a vegan survival kit for the ride: a Chewybacca cookie (there was Chewy bobblehead next to the cookies), a brownie, and two bagels (egg salad and bbq chickpea). We were so full from the brunch we kept the brownie for the next day.

I didn't plan this blog post while I was in Leipzig, which is why I don't have many photos. I'll make sure to take more next time.
