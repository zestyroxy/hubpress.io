+++<u>Ingredients</u>+++
[square]
- 3/4 cup oats (I use )
- 1 1/2 cup soy milk (you can use water or another non-dairy milk)
- 1 persimmon
- 4 tbps raisins (pre-soaked)
- 4 tbsp rum
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/8 tsp cardamon
- 1-2 tbsp maple syrup
- 2 of cocoa nibs (optional)

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++

*Evening before*
[square]
- The evening before, place the raisins and rum into a tupperware. Shake together and let sit. This can be done a few days in advance or in larger quantities, just make the content ratio 1:1.

*Morning*
[square]
- Peel the persimmon and cut it up into small pieces. Save a few thin slices for decoration (1 slice per bowl).
- Add all the ingredients to a pot, except for the maple syrup and cocoa nibs.
- Heat the content on high until it boils/bubbles. Stir constantly or it will stick to the bottom of the pot.
- Stir until it is thick - I prefer it very thick, but that is not for everyone.
- Taste it and add more spices to fit your taste.
- Pour porridge into the bowl, sprinkle the cocoa nibs on top, pour a bit of maple syrup for extra sweetness and place your persimmon slice.

Now, prepare your favourite cup of tea or coffee and enjoy. My favourite mornings are making porridge before sunrise and watching the sunrise as I eat! So relaxing. Makes you appreaciate the worlds beauty.
