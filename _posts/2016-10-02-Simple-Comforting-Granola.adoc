I've been making this granola recipe at home for over a year and I simply love it! It's easy, versatile, and can be used for various things: breakfast bowl, desert topping, cute homemade gift, what have you.

* 550 g old fashion, rolled, or large oats
* 50 g brown sugar (basically just white sugar mixed with molasses)

. Set the oven to 175 C.
. Place the oats in a large bowl, add brown sugar, and mix thoroughly with you hands.
. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil and maple syrup. Once mixed, add immediately to the oats and sugar mixture. Stir until all the oat flakes are covered in oil, I used a fork.
. Add the seeds or nuts and stir until evenly combined.

+++<u>Baking Instructions</u>+++
[square]
. Cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper, the paper should spill over each side.
. Pour oat mixture on the parchment paper and spead evenly with a wooden spoon.
. If the parchment paper is too long cut the excess off.
. Place in the oven for 5 minute intervals, for a total of 25 minutes, stirring the oats  every time to make sure they bake evenly.
. Once the 25 minutes are up, make sure the oats are crisp and golden. If they aren't, bake for another 5 minutes. 
. Take the oats out of the even and let cool.


Once the oats have cooled add your favourite granola ingredients such as, coconut flakes, raisins, dried cranberries, apricots, #allthegranolathings! Personally, I like to keep it very simple so my daily recipes can be different all the time. I just add the ingredients I feel like having when I am preparing my meal.

Keep your granola in a jar or well sealed container and in dry place. You can store it for up to 3 weeks, but in our house of two, we usually consume it within 1.5 weeks. :)

This morning, I made a granola, almond butter, warm raspberry bowl with coconut milk yogurt and chia seeds.
