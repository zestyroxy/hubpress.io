= Becoming Vegan!

My name is Roxanne Joncas. I am Canadian that lives in Kiel, Germany. For the past two years, I have been a "vegepreferian" (term coined by my friend Wayne) that indulges in minimalism. I have decided to make my lifestyle a more sensible, mindful, and conscious one. That is why I have decided to become vegan. I will be posting my journey on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3u3YZ35NU1Zl3zxRH3d7OA).

Join in on the fun, follow my journey or become a vegan and share your thoughts/ideas!
