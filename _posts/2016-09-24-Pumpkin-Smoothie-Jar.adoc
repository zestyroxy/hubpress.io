= Pumpkin Smoothie Jar

:hp-tags: [vegan, pumpkin, smoothie, fall, breakfast]

Since fall (my favourite season) is here I decided to bake three different pumpkin recipies! Here is the first one: Pumpkin Smoothie Jar. #PumpkinAllTheThings

This is an easy and delicious breakfast. It smells so good, it'll make you want to curl up with a good book and a hot cup of coffee by the fire while you slowly enjoy every bite.

*Pumpkin Smoothie*

The first step to making a pumpkin smoothie jar is to make the smoothie. For this recipe, I used the pumpkin purée that I make myself last night, but you can definitely use store bought pumpkin purée. Scroll down to the end of this post to read how to make your very own pumpkin purée.

*Pumpkin Purée*

I prefer to make my own pumpkin purée when pumpkin are in season. It just tastes so good and I know the only ingredient is, well pumpkin. 

Go to the store and get yourself a pumpkin. Pro tip: make it the night before you want to make your favourite pumpkin recipe.
