= Pumpkin Smoothie Jar

:hp-tags: [vegan, pumpkin, smoothie, fall, breakfast]

Since fall is here I decided to bake three different pumpkin recipies! Here is the first one: Pumpkin Smoothie Jar.

This is a really easy breakfast to make. It smells so good, it'll make you want to curl up with a good book and a hot cup of coffee by the fire while you slowly enjoy every bite.

*Pumpkin Smoothie*

The first step to making a pumpkin smoothie jar is to make the smoothie. For this recipe, I used the pumpkin purée that I make myself, but you can definitely use store bought pumpkin purée. Scroll down to view the simple recipe to make your very own pumpkin purée

. Add fruits or other nuts according to your cravings today!

You're done! You can also just drink the smoothie on it's own. I would suggest simply adding a bit more almond milk to thin it out a bit.

*Pumpkin Purée*

You can either buy pumpkin purée in a can or make your own. I prefer to make my own, it's pretty simple, all you need is a small pumpkin. Pro tip: make it the night before you want to make your favourite pumpkin recipe.

. Cut the pumpkin halves lengthwise into six slices. 
. Arrange the pumpkin slices outter skin down on a baking pan, no oil is needed.
. Bake the pumpkin for one hour, or until you can easily poke a fork through the skin.
. Once ready, take out of the even and let it cool.
. After it has cooled down, use you hands to peel the outer skin off the pulp.

Voilà! Keep your purée in the fridge for up to a week or freeze some for later use.
