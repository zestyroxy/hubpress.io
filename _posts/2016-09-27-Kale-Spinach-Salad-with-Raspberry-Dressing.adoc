+++<u>Note</u>+++: This makes a serving for one person if the meal will consist of a salad or two people if the salad is going to be a side dish.


*Kale & Spinach Salad*

+++<u>Salad Ingredients</u>+++
[square]
* 2 large kale leaves
* 2 handfuls of spinach
* 20 g pine nuts
* 1 spring onion
* 1/3 lemon
* 1 apple (I used Macintosh because they are in season right now in Canada)
* 3 ml coconut oil

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++
[square]
. Remove the hard stem portion of the kale and cut the leaves in very thin slices with a knife.
. Put the kale in a medium sized bowl and squeeze 1/3 of a lemon's juice over it. Massage the juice into the kale with your hands. This will soften the kale.
. In the meantime, heat up 3 ml of coconut oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the pine nuts and roast them until golden. This should only take a few minutes.
. Cut your apple into thin slices and your spring onion into small rings.
. Add the spinach over the kale and mix so the spinach is evenly distributed.
. Add the apple slices, spring onion rings, roasted pine nuts and raspberry dressing.
. Add other ingredients that you fancy, like avocado!
