I am obsessed with smoothie bowls as you can problably tell from my instagram feed :). At home, we make banana nicecream every other day. This turned out to be one of my favourite combinations and wanted to share it because it's so perfect for New Year's morning breakfast.

== NiceCream

+++<u> Ingredients</u>+++
[square]
- 3/4 cup soy or almond milk
- 2 frozen bananas (freeze overnight)
- 1-2 tbsp hemp hearts
- 1/3 cup peanut butter
- 1-2 tbsp cocao powder

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++
[square]
- Place all the ingredients in a high powered blender.
- Blend until smooth - you may need to stop the blender and give it a bit of help with a spoon or a stir stick. If it is really stuck, add more milk, but only a bit at a time.
- It should have a thick nicecream consistency.
Note: If you prefer a more smoothie like consistency over the ice cream consistency, add more milk.

[square]

- 6 tbsp of soy or almond per serving cup 

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++
