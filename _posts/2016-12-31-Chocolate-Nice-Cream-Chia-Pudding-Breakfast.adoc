I am obsessed with smoothie bowls and nice cream, as you can problably tell from my instagram feed :). At home, we make banana nice cream every other day; the flavours vary from peanut butter, to tropical fruit. This recipe turned out to be one of my favourite combinations and I wanted to share it because it's so perfect for New Year's morning breakfast.

== Nice Cream

+++<u> Ingredients</u>+++
[square]
- 3/4 cup soy or almond milk
- 2 frozen bananas (freeze overnight)
- 1 tbsp hemp hearts
- 1/3 cup peanut butter
- 2 tbsp cocao powder

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++
[square]
- Place all the ingredients in a high powered blender.
- Blend until smooth - you may need to stop the blender and give it a bit of help with a spoon or a stir stick. If it is really stuck, add more milk, but only a bit at a time.
- It should have a thick soft serve ice cream consistency.
Note: If you prefer a more smoothie like consistency, simply add more milk.

== Chia Seed Pudding
+++<u>Ingredients</u>+++
[square]
- 1 tbsp of chia seeds per serving cup 
- 6 tbsp of soy or almond per serving cup 

+++<u>Instructions</u>+++

- Mix the ingredients together in each individual serving cup. 
- Let it sit in the fridge overnight, stiring twice within the first few hours.
- In the morning, give it a stir; the consistency should be pudding like. If it's too thick, add a bit more milk and stir it until blended.

- First layer will be the chia seed pudding. I prepare the pudding directly in the serving cups so there is no transfer needed, but you can make a big portion and spoon it into your serving cups later on.
- Scoop chocolate peanut butter nice cream on top
- Cut ginger thin cookies in half and place them in the nice cream so they stand on their own. (I used the Pepparakaka ginger thins from Ikea, so tasty!)
- Sprinkle your favourite muesli, granola or oat mix on top. (I used a vegan christmas muesli mix we made and ordered online from Mymuesli.)
