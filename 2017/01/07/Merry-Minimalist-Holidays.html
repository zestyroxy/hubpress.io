<p>This year, we decided to SKIP Christmas! OK, technically that&#8217;s not true, but we decided to break tradition and stay home. The decision was made a few months early because we wanted to spend some quiet time with ourselves; ourselves as individuals and together as a couple.</p>

<p>For all four "big" days/evenings, we stayed home and cooked lovely meals together. We also spent 2 of our 10 days off in Hamburg, our favourite German city. There we watched Rogue One at the <a href="http://www.savoy-filmtheater.de/">Savoy Theatre</a>. This theatre is wonderful because it shows films in their original version, which can be hard to find in Germany. They also have Vegan popcorn - salty, sweet, and caramel! We walked around the beautiful city, peaked into shops, had treats at the Weihnachtsmarkt, and bought our favourite coffee at the <a href="http://www.speicherstadt-kaffee.de/">Speicherstadt Kaffeerösterei</a>. For dinner we ate delicious vegan pizza at <a href="http://www.pizza-bande.de/">Pizza Bande</a> and Sushi at <a href="http://www.raw-like-sushi.de/en/">Raw Like Sushi</a> (foodporn at the end of the post). The rest of the time was spent relaxing at home reading, napping, doing yoga, baking, or out with friends. Our biggest outing this holiday season was our friends' small and wonderful wedding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have to be honest, it has been the most wonderful Christmas time since I stopped believing in Santa Claus. The past week was so calm, relaxing, and fulfilling. I had time to let go of work, find myself again, and do what I love. I even found new passions and interest; this only happens when my brain is calm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This week, I spoke with a few friends and they mentioned that they felt like they needed a holiday from their Christmas holiday. Which is why I want to share tips on how to spend a Merry Minimalist Holiday Season!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_tips">Tips</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stay Home or Elope:</strong> My best advice for a calm holiday season is to escape. Create your own hideout or escape to a remote location with someone you feel %100 comfortable with; that person can be you. Once in your hideout, relax, let go, and be yourself. Now, explore the emotions you’ve been bottling up all year because you’ve been too busy to process them. Once that is done – explore the world &amp; learn new things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During those four important holi"days", both Christmas and New Year’s eves/days, don’t worry about where you should or could be, just be happy with where you are <u>now</u>. Have a lovely dinner and celebrate what you’re thankful for. Oh, and call your loved ones – you might be eloping but you’re still a decent, loving person. Right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Over Schedule:</strong> Rushing sucks. We can&#8217;t help but feel rushed during the holidays. So many things to get done, so many people around trying to complete their gift list. Plan only a few things and for the rest, just go with the flow. Do what you feel like doing, when you feel like doing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Minimize Decorations:</strong> If you hate decorating and find it stressful, minimize it! Minimalist decorations look modern and chic. This year, we decorated our home with 1 small tree with stars wrapped around it, 3 homemade origami trees, and a starprint table runner. We named our small Christmas tree Chuck. Chuck, the tree.</p>

<p><strong>Fuck Gift Giving:</strong> We are all adults here. I hope. Kids if you&#8217;re reading this&#8230;&#8203; ah fuck it. If you can read, you’ve seen these words before. As I was saying, we are adults and we know what we want and what we need. We can go out and buy whatever we want, whenever we want. In fact, we can open a magical box, type in our wishes and use a magical card code that sends an invisible promise of money to get these wants and needs delivered straight to our door. You could do this solely with your little finger, if you choose to. But that would be a waste of time in my opinion. Point is, we don&#8217;t need gifts and we don&#8217;t need to give gifts to be happy and merry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the holidays, my favourite thing to do is eat and share the food-love. Homemade food-love cures all. If you must give someone a gift, make it consumable, preferably edible and homemade :) Examples are: Cinema gift card, pay for a dinner with them, give them wine, bake them cookies!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re going to cancel gift giving, be sure to inform your family ahead of time. It’s the decent thing to do. This also means they might (hopefully) stop buying you gifts and you can stop lying to their faces about loving said gifts! If you actually love the presents your family give you that is wonderful, but still not worth the stress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Ring in the New Year Debt-free:</strong> The great thing about not buying gifts is you don&#8217;t have to stress out about money. Period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Eat:</strong> Spend time eating what you love. Eat slowly and mindfully. Enjoy it! Some of my favourite moments are spent in the kitchen cooking with my partner, Stefan. We get creative and have fun with it. If it burns or tastes horrible, don&#8217;t sweat it, make simple nachos or order take-out!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Take a few days to just reconnect with yourself and do what you really love. Read, travel to a new place, sleep, cook, blog, have sex, whatever YOU want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love cooking/baking and photography (amongst other things).</p>

<p><strong>Declutter your Life:</strong> This one is a big one and might seem unachievable, but you need to approach it a step at a time. You should start by gathering information through research and reading. The minimalists have many wonderful blog posts to help you <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/start/">get started</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used to have a big house with 14 rooms, including 5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 2 living rooms, a double-garage, a pool, lots of furniture, trinkets, and useless decorations. Now, I live in a 1 bedroom apartment. There are only two of us after all and we don&#8217;t need more space. We only keep the necessities and it feels like a big weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I can focus on what is important. This also means that welcoming guests isn&#8217;t stressful because cleaning the entire place takes less than an hour a week! The lack of clutter will already remove half of the weight off your shoulders. To learn more about decluttering, read these fine articles: <a href="https://zenhabits.net/declutter-course/">The Minimalist Way to Declutter</a> and <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/decluttering-principles/">10 Decluttering Principles to Help Anyone Clear the Clutter</a>.</p>

<p>Remember these are just suggestions. You don’t have to take every slice of advice. Adapt and make it your own – you know yourself best! And please, stop worrying about what other will think or feel. Choose to do something for yourself. Something for you and the family members living in your home.</p>
